Q1.) What is statically type and dynamically typed programming language?
Statically typed and dynamically typed programming languages are two different paradigms regarding how variables are handled in a programming language.
1.Statically Typed Programming Language:
-> In a statically typed language, variable types are known and checked at compile time.
-> This means that the type of every variable must be explicitly declared by the programmer.
-> Once a variable is declared with a certain type, it cannot change to another type during the execution of the program.
-> Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and Rust.
2.Dynamically Typed Programming Language:
-> In a dynamically typed language, variable types are not explicitly declared by the programmer.
-> Types are resolved at runtime, meaning the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.
-> Dynamically typed languages offer more flexibility but may lead to runtime errors if types are not handled properly.
-> Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

Q2.) What is variable in java?
In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value of a particular data type. Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout the program. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the kind of data it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. For example- int age = 15;

Q.3) How to asign a value to variable?
Assigning a value to a variable in Java involves using the assignment operator (=) to associate a value with a variable. Here's the general syntax:-
variableName = value;
int age; //Declaration of an integer variable named 'age'
age = 10; // Assigning the value 18 to the variable 'age'.

Q.4) What are the primitive Data type in java?
Primitive data types: These are the basic data types that are predefined and supported by Java. They include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. Primitive data types have a fixed size and range, and they do not have any additional methods or attributes.

Q.5) What are the identifiers in java?
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

Q.6) List the Operators in java?
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while * is also an operator used for multiplication.
Operators in Java can be classified into 5 types:
1.Arithmetic Operators{+,-,*,/,%}
2.Assignment Operators{=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=}
3.Relational Operators{==,>,<,>=,<=,!=}
4.Logical Operators{&&(Logical ANd),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)}
5.Unary Operators{+(Inary plus),-(unary minus),++(increamment operator),--(decreament operator),!(Logical complement operator)}
6.Bitwise Operators{~,<<,>>,>>>,&,^}
